That’s when Anisphia concocts a plan to help Euphyllia regain her good name-which somehow involves them living together and researching magic!

When he thinks back on that time of his life, all he has are fleeting fantasies of a happy adolescence that could have been. Imagine his bewilderment and surprise, then, when he inexplicably finds himself seven years in the past—one month before his first year of high school!

Or will he be forced to relive three years of solitude as the most hated guy in school?
